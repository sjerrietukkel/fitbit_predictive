# Fitbit Predictive Model

This project consists of the cleaning, combining and predicting data from FitBit Zips received from French volunteers. For a [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29084709/#:~:text=The%20most%20important%20determinants%20are,related%20aspects%20of%20activity%20trackers) in France, over 900 volunteers received a Fitbit Zip (a clip-on activity tracker) and recorded their daily steps, distance and calories.. The data were simulated from the actual data to conform to the GDPR law.
